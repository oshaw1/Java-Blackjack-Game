# Java-Blackjack-Game
In a Java module, I was tasked with developing a version of the card game Blackjack. The goal of the assignment was to create a functional, user-friendly game that adhered to the standard rules of Blackjack.

I began by designing the basic structure of the program, including classes for the deck of cards, the player and the dealer. I implemented methods to shuffle the deck, deal cards, and calculate the scores of the player and dealer. I also wrote code to handle the various actions that a player can take during the game, such as "hit" or "stand", as well as the logic for the dealer's actions.

I then added a user interface using JavaFX, which allowed the player to interact with the game through a graphical interface. This included buttons for the player to make their decisions, as well as labels to display the cards and scores of the player and dealer.

I also implemented logic for edge cases and special rules like "Blackjack" and "Bust" and added an option for betting.

Overall, the assignment was a great opportunity to practice my Java programming skills, as well as learn more about object-oriented programming and user interface design. It was a challenging task that required me to think carefully about the logic of the game, but I was able to create a functional and enjoyable Blackjack game at the end.
